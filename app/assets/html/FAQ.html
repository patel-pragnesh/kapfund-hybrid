<p class=MsoNormal>1. What is KAP Fund?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAP Fund is a mobile application available on
Apple and Android products that allows consumers to purchase concessions
directly from their smartphone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. How much does KAP Fund cost?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAP Fund is free to download but charges a
convenience fee for orders that are processed from your phone. The convenience
fee varies based on the total purchased order and service options but will be
added to the total cart value upon checkout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. What is my KAP Fund account?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The KAP Fund account stores your personal
information including username, password, cellphone number, email and credit
card data. The account information also logs receipts and allows you to review
previous orders that were processed on your account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. How secure is KAP Fund?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAP Fund will never share your personal
information with third parties specific to the terms and conditions. Your
credit card information is stored on an encrypted server that is PCI compliant.
KAP Fund is audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to
PCI Service Provider Level 1, this is the most stringent level of certification
available. All card numbers are encrypted on disk with AES-256.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Where do my orders get billed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you place an order through KAP Fund our
mobile application bills the credit card on-file provided during the account
set up process. All charges will appear on your credit card's monthly statement
like any other credit card purchases. No additional charges will be placed on
to your mobile phone for engaging in our services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. How do I get ahold of my order?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your order will be delivered to a designated location inside
the venue. This location will be selected by the user and will allow users to
input their specific location (i.e. Section, Row, Seat, etc.). Ballpark
Concierge is not responsible for users who submit invalid information so please
be mindful upon checkout. If a delivery attempt fails because user is not in
their seat upon delivery, the user will receive a text stating delivery has
failed and the order can be picked up at the 'Express Window'. There is never a
follow up delivery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. How do I select a venue?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Venue selection occurs during the initial launch of the
application. GPS will select the closest venue available to the user. If the
selected location is not correct, the user then will have the option to select
from a list of venues that is currently using the KAP Fund App. It is
important that users select the appropriate venue. KAP Fund will not
be responsible for users who accidently select the incorrect venue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8. What if I forgot my password?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a user forgets their password they will have the option
to select 'forgot password'. A new password will be emailed to the email on
file for the user. The user will then be asked to put the new password in and
to select a different password to continue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9. How do I update or edit my credit card information?</p>

selecting the 'my account' icon. Once a user verifies their credentials all
credit card information can be edited or updated.</p>

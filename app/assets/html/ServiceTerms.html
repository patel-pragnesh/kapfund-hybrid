			APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. This waiver of warranty affects your specific
			legal rights; you may have rights which may vary depending upon where you are

			<p class=MsoNormal>8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED
			BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
			EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, SERVICE PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, OR OTHERS INVOLVED IN

			IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE
			APPLICATION, HOWEVER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE AND/OR WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE CLAIMED
			IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHER ACTION, EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
			POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COVERED PARTIES' COLLECTIVE
			LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WHATSOEVER HEREUNDER (OR ASSOCIATED HEREWITH) EXCEED
			THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FROM ALL OF YOUR ORDERS THROUGH THE APPLICATION IN THE
			TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM. Some jurisdictions do
			not allow for the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
			damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>9. Indemnification. You agree to defend and indemnify the
			Company and the Covered Parties from and against any claims, causes of action,
			demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties, or other costs or

			the Application to submit an Order for or on behalf of a third party, such as a
			family member or friend, you are responsible for the Order, including, without
			limitation, the accuracy of information provided in connection with such Order
			including, without limitation, credit card and credit card holder information.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>11. User Comments, Feedback, and Other Submissions. All comments,
			feedback, suggestions and ideas disclosed, submitted, or offered to the Company
			in connection with your use of the Application (collectively, 'Comments') shall
			be and remain the exclusive property of the Company and may be used by the
			Company in any medium in accordance with our Privacy Policy and you agree to
			execute any documents that may be necessary for such an assignment of rights.
			User Comments could be used on the Application, and in radio, television, and
			print advertisements. Your first name, first initial of your last name, and
			town and state may be used with any Comments you submit. The information and
			opinions expressed in Comments are not necessarily those of the Company or its
			Service Providers, advertisers, sponsors, affiliated or related entities, and
			the Company makes no representations or warranties regarding any Comment. The
			Company does not represent the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any
			Comments or determine whether the Comments violate the rights of others. You
			acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by other users of the
			Application will be at your own risk. The Company is not under any obligation
			to maintain your Comments in confidence, to pay you any compensation for any
			Comments submitted, or to respond to any of your Comments. You agree that you
			will be solely responsible for the content of any Comment you create.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>12. Third-Party Content and Services. To the extent the
			Application contains links or access to outside, third-party content and
			services, such third-party is solely responsible for such content and services.
			The Company makes no representations regarding, and is not liable or
			responsible for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability, or
			availability of any of such third-party content or services. If you choose to
			access any such third-party content and services, you do so at your own risk.
			The ability to access such third-party content and services through the
			Application does not constitute or imply the Company's endorsement, sponsorship,
			or recommendation of the third-party, or of the content, products or services
			contained on, or available through such third-party.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>13. Modification or Termination of Application. The Company
			reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate
			the Application or any portion thereof, including any service or product
			available through the Application. In the event of termination, you will still
			be bound by your obligations under this Agreement and any additional terms,
			including the warranties made by you, and by the disclaimers and limitations of
			liability. Additionally, the Company shall not be liable to you or any
			third-party for any termination of your access to the App.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>14. Order Delays, Errors. While the Company will use its good
			faith efforts to respond to Orders within the time periods indicated on the
			Application and to deliver Orders error free, no guarantee is made that the
			status of your Order will be made available to you within the stated processing
			time or will be error free. Neither the Company nor its Service Providers are
			responsible for any delays or errors in attempting to fulfill an Order beyond
			our control including, without limitation, error or delays in responding to an
			Order caused by technical problems beyond our control. In the event of an error
			in an Order, your sole remedy is a refund as to that portion of the Order that
			was in error. If you notify us of such error, and your credit card has already
			been charged, we will promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in
			the amount of the charge. In order to receive a credit for an incorrect Order,
			you must notify us within four (4) hours from the time the Order was submitted.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>15. Pricing Errors. We endeavor to publish and maintain
			accurate prices, product item names, pictures and description, and information
			for the products and services offered through the Application. Our Service
			Providers provide us with the price and other information related to these
			products and services. In the event, however, that a product or service is
			listed or provided to us at an incorrect price or with incorrect information
			due to typographical error or other error in pricing or product or service
			information received from our Service Providers, we retain the right to refuse or
			cancel any Orders placed for such product or service. We shall have the right
			to refuse or cancel any such Orders whether or not the order has been confirmed
			and/or your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged
			for the purchase and your Order is canceled because of incorrect Service
			Provider information, we will promptly issue a credit to your credit card
			account in the amount of the charge.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>16. Notifications. To the extent that we need to contact you
			regarding an Order, in addition to any in-application notification, you agree
			that we may contact you via text message or email.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>17. Service Providers. You agree to abide by the terms or
			conditions of purchase imposed by any Service Provider, including, but not
			limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the Service
			Provider's rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of prices,
			products, or services. You understand that any violation of any such Service
			Provider's conditions of purchase may result in cancellation of your Order(s).</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>18. Products and Services.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>(<span class=GramE>a</span>) General. Products and services
			available through the Application are subject to the published conditions of
			purchase and rules of the applicable Service Provider. In addition, products
			and services can be subject to the local, state and federal laws or/and
			regulations governing the sale and preparation of such product</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>(b) Taxes and Fees. In connection with facilitating your
			Order, the Service Providers will charge you for the product cost and taxes and
			fees. Government (local, state and/or federal) imposed taxes and fees, any
			applicable Service Providers imposed fees and the Company's fees are either
			included in your price or itemized separately on your checkout screen/page to
			provide a total purchase cost. Except as provided below, we are not the vendor
			collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. The
			Service Provider will bill and collect applicable taxes and remit the portions
			related to the product cost directly to the appropriate jurisdictions and will
			remit to us the taxes associated with our fees. Taxability and the appropriate
			tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by venue location. The
			Company's convenience fees for fulfilling an Order are included in the amount
			of your Order. The convenience fee amount varies depending upon product items,
			venue, season, event, and other factors and applies to both products and
			services.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>(c) Additional Rules and Restrictions. As some products are
			perishable in nature, except as provided in Section 14, all Orders for such
			product items are non-returnable, non-cancelable, and non-changeable. At the
			time your Order is accepted, your method of payment will be charged for the
			total order amount shown, regardless of whether or not you will have actually
			picked the ordered product items up. This rule will also apply regardless of
			whether or not you were present or absent from your seat to accept the
			requested the perishable product items in cases when attempted in-seat delivery
			was made. Once an Order is submitted, whether the product is perishable or
			non-perishable, it cannot be modified by you.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>19. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed by the
			internal laws of the State of Missouri. If any term, condition, or covenant set
			out in this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
			terms and provisions hereof and the application of such term or provision to
			persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid or
			unenforceable shall not be affected thereby. The Company may assign the benefit
			of or obligations under this Agreement to any person at any time. This
			Agreement (including the covenants and conditions set out herein) are made
			expressly and solely for the benefit of the specified party, and no other
			person shall be entitled to or deemed to be entitled to any benefits or rights
			hereunder, nor be authorized or entitled to enforce any rights, claims, or
			remedies hereunder or by reason hereof. This Agreement constitutes the entire
			agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
			supersedes any prior agreement or understanding among or between them with
			respect to such subject matter.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>Ballpark Concierge, Inc. (the 'Company') respects the privacy
			of visitors to our website and registrants of our application. This Privacy
			Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the
			collection, use and disclosure of any personal information you submit to or
			through our website or application. By using our Smart Phone Application and accessing
			our website at ballparkconcierge.com (together, the 'App') you are consenting
			to the information collection and use practices described in this policy, as
			modified from time to time by us. If we decide to change our privacy statement,
			we will post a new policy on our App and change the 'last updated' date on the
			policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy policy
			whenever you visit this App for any updates or changes. Please see our Terms
			&amp; Conditions for a more detailed legal explanation of our general online
			policies.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>1. Information We Collect.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>a. Tracking Cookies.&nbsp;<br>
			The Company logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on
			the Internet) and internal phone device ID in order to improve security,
			analyze trends and administer the App. We may track your movement within the
			App, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. We
			only use this information in aggregate and do not link it to you personally
			unless you opt in as a customer. To gauge the effectiveness of our App, we do
			collect some generic information about our visitors. Our network computer
			servers automatically recognize a visitor's domain name, the web page from
			which a visitor enters our App, which pages a visitor visits on our App, and
			how much time a visitor spends on each page. We may use anonymous tracking
			technologies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical
			purposes and to improve the products and services we provide. We aggregate this
			information and use it to evaluate and improve our App. We store information
			that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party
			sources for instance to verify your address or update your information and to
			create a 'profile' of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable
			information to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored
			promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the App for you.
			A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer or phone for
			record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this App. We use session ID cookies
			and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to
			navigate our App. A session ID cookie expires when you close your App or
			browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period
			of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in
			your Internet browser's 'help' file. Persistent cookies are used to
			differentiate subscribers from non-subscribers to customize the content of
			certain sections of the App and enable us to track and target the interests of
			our users to enhance the experience on our App. If you reject cookies, you may
			still use our App, but your ability to use some areas of our App, such as
			promotions or surveys, may be limited.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>b. Surveys or Promotions.&nbsp;<br>
			From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in
			sweepstakes or other promotions on our App, which might be sponsored or
			conducted by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain
			personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these
			sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or
			not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes
			contact information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make
			sure to review that party's privacy policy.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>c. Referrals.&nbsp;<br>
			We may from time to time conduct a referral service to introduce people you
			know to our App and services. If you choose to use our referral service to tell
			a friend about our App, we will ask you for your friend's name and email
			address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him
			or her to visit the App. The Company stores this information for the purpose of
			sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
			Your friend may contact us at ballparkconcierge.com/remove to request that we
			remove this information from our database.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>d. Registration and Transactional Data.&nbsp;<br>
			When you register on our App, we may collect various kinds of Personal
			Information including your name, mobile phone number and e-mail address. We
			also collect and store access information related to your account including
			user name and user password. When you make purchases from our App, we may
			collect purchasing information such as product orders and credit card
			information. We also send receipts to your email address. Users may voluntarily
			register their accounts online or at this App. When you register your account
			we may collect additional personal information such as birth date, card number,
			and city of birth. This information may be linked to your purchasing history.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>e. Registration and Authentication.&nbsp;<br>
			When you register with us on the App, you are required to submit a mobile phone
			number and an e-mail address (which is your user id for the App) and password.
			Additional information may be included in your registration profile such as
			name, address and billing information. At registration, you are given the
			opportunity to specify your privacy preferences. As described below, you may
			change these preferences at any time.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>f. Customer Service Correspondence.&nbsp;<br>
			We may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit
			comments, questions or suggestions to our Customer Service department.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>2. Use of Your Personal and Non-Personal Information.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>a. Aggregate Information.&nbsp;<br>
			We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our App whenever you
			use the App or visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of
			&quot;click stream&quot; information such as entry and exit points for our App
			(i.e., referring URLs or domains), App traffic statistics, page views,
			impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users
			request pages on our App, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An
			IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever
			you are surfing the Web. We also use third-party software that tracks traffic
			directed to our App from affiliate Web or Phone Apps and the purchases that
			result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an
			individual purchase.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>b. Vendors and Service Providers.&nbsp;<br>
			We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
			Examples might include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive
			information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing
			assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service.
			They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
			may not use it for other purposes.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>c. Service-Related Announcements.&nbsp;<br>
			We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when
			it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
			for maintenance, or the delivery of a service or product is delayed we might
			send you an email, or if there is some service issue with something you might
			have ordered. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are
			not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the
			option to cancel your account with us in the Settings area.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>d. Co-Branded Service Offerings.&nbsp;<br>
			We may share your personally identifiable information with certain businesses
			with whom the Company has formed a strategic alliance. You will be able to
			identify these businesses because the Company has authorized them to display
			co-branded Web pages or links to the App. These strategic partners are
			requested to clearly state their own privacy policies on their own web Apps or
			promotional materials. If you do not want to have your personal information
			shared with these businesses you may adjust your preferences in your account at
			any time.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>e. Third Party Offers.&nbsp;<br>
			We share personally identifiable information with Third Parties in order to
			have them send you special offers and promotions that we think you might find
			of interest to you. We will also occasionally send you information on products,
			services, special deals, or promotions, which we have found that are of
			interest to our customers. If you do not want the Company to use the
			information you provide in order to inform you of products and services that
			might be of interest to you, or to provide your information to third party
			companies you can adjust your preferences at any time.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>f. Exceptional Circumstances.&nbsp;<br>
			If the Company, or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is
			sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or
			otherwise, the relevant customer database of the Company could, in whole or in
			part, be sold as part of that transaction. In such transactions, personal
			information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
			Policy in effect when the information was obtained. We also may have to release
			personally identifying information when it is necessary to comply with judicial
			or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or to protect the rights,
			property, or safety of the Company or others. This includes exchanging
			information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>3. Choice and Opt-Out.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your
			personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for
			this information. If you are registered with our App, please sign-in and use
			the preference form at Your Account. If you have NOT completed the registration
			process, please e-mail your request to be removed to ballparkconcierge.com/optout.
			If you do not wish to receive any promotional materials associated with your
			use of the account from us or a third party, you may log in to your account on
			either mobile phone or website and change your privacy preferences at any time.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>4. Access to Your Information.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>If for any reason you are concerned that the personal
			information maintained by the Company is not correct, please sign-in to the App
			and use the online form at the Your Account page to change or close your
			account. Should you wish to have your email address removed from our mailing
			list or sharing list, please send an email to ballparkconcierge.com/remove. We
			will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. We may
			still retain your information in our files however, to resolve disputes,
			enforce our user agreement, and due to technical and legal requirements and
			constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Apps.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>5. Data Security.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>We have reasonable security procedures in place for the storage
			and disclosure of personal information, which you have given us in order to
			prevent unauthorized access. We implement industry-standard electronic means of
			protecting your personal information. Keep in mind however, that no method of
			transmission over the Internet or the wireless network, or method of electronic
			storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
			acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
			absolute security. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized
			access to your password and to mobile phone and your computer. Be sure to sign
			off when finished using a shared computer or shared phone. Our App may also
			contain links to other Phone or Web Apps. Keep in mind that the Company does
			not control and is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the
			content of these or other Phone or Web Apps.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>6. How to Contact Us.</p>

			use of your information, or if you need help changing or deleting your account

				<b>Donor Policy</b>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The KAP Fund, Inc. will not sell, trade or share a donor's personal information with anyone else,
				nor send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations. KAP Fund, Inc. will only share
				personal information once the donor has given specific permission to do so.
				The Donor Bill of Rights was created by the American Association of Fundraising Counsel
				(AAFRC), Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Association of Fundraising
				Professionals (AFP), and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE). It has
				been endorsed by numerous organizations including KAP Fund, Inc. and was adapted for use
				as a source of information for our donors.
				The Donor Bill of Rights
				Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and
				sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and
				trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in
				the schools and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
				1. To be informed of the schools’ mission, of the way the school intends to use donations,
				and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
				2. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the school district governing board,
				and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
				3. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
				4. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
				5. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with
				confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
				6. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to
				the donor will be professional in nature.
				7. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that a school
				may intend to share.
				8. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and
				forthright answers.
				How does KAP Fund, Inc. protect my Information?
				KAP Fund, Inc. institute various electronic and administrative safeguards that are reasonably
				designed to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, including
				firewall technologies to help protect your data from hackers and other unwanted visitors. Also,
				access to the Profile Information contained in your account is protected by use of a password,
				so you should keep your password private and secure. Despite use of these safeguards, there
				are inherent risks in transmission of electronic information. We cannot guarantee and do not
				represent that your personally identifiable information will always be secure from unauthorized
				access.
				We also may use a managed hosting provider and/or other subcontractors to assist us with the
				provision and maintenance of the Sites. If we do, we will impose on such provider confidentiality
				obligations for the treatment of information.
				What constitutes my acceptance of this Privacy Policy?
				By using the app, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described
				in this Policy. KAP Fund, Inc. may modify this Policy at any time and will post a change notice
				with the new Policy on this app. Your continued use of the app after the posting of the change
				notice to the Policy will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.
				Where does the money go?
				85 cents of every dollar goes directly to the school of your choice to support the athletic program
				of your choosing. However, we do not in any way monitor the use of the funds with any school
				nor school district.
